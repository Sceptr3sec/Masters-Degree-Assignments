üß© Task
Mastermind is a classic logic-based code-breaking game that challenges players to deduce a hidden sequence through strategic guessing and deduction. In this implementation, the secret code consists of 4 unique digits, each ranging from 0 to 8. The player has 10 attempts to guess the exact combination.

After each guess, the program provides feedback in two categories:

Well placed: Correct digits in the correct positions.

Misplaced: Correct digits but in the wrong positions.

The player wins if they successfully guess the exact code within the allotted attempts.

üõ†Ô∏è Description
To generate the secret code, a random number generator was implemented using the time module as a seed to ensure unpredictable outcomes. The initial version of the game relied heavily on nested if-else logic and attempted to use C functions like scanf, getchar, and fgets for input. However, these approaches led to compilation issues and unstable behavior due to formatting and buffer handling challenges.

After revisiting the design, the code was refactored to use clean, robust logic and standard C input/output techniques for better reliability and maintainability. The result is a streamlined version of the game that validates player input and delivers accurate feedback after each guess.

üß± Installation
To build the project, ensure you have gcc or a compatible C compiler installed, then use the provided Makefile:

bash
Copy
Edit
make
This will compile the source code and generate the my_mastermind executable in the current directory.

üöÄ Usage
Run the game from the terminal using:

bash
Copy
Edit
./my_mastermind
You can optionally provide a secret code using the -c flag followed by a 4-digit sequence of distinct digits (from 0 to 8):

bash
Copy
Edit
./my_mastermind -c 1234
If no code is provided, one will be randomly generated by the game.
