🐱 Task
The objective of this assignment was to reimplement a simplified version of the Unix cat command in C. The program reads one or more files provided as command-line arguments and prints their contents to standard output.

🛠️ Description
This project demonstrates basic file I/O operations, command-line argument parsing, and buffer-based reading in C. Unlike the full-featured cat command, this implementation does not support flags or options — it simply reads and echoes file contents sequentially.

🔧 Installation
Ensure you have the gcc compiler installed. Then compile the source file:

🚀 Usage
Run the compiled program with one or more file arguments:

./my_cat file1.txt file2.txt

The contents of each file will be printed in the order they were passed.
