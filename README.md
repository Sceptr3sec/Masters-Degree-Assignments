# Master's Degree Assignments (Software Engineering)

This repository contains selected assignments, projects, and labs completed as part of my Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document my academic journey, showcase technical skills, and share solutions and insights gained through hands-on experience across a wide range of software engineering topics.

All code, reports, and exercises were written from scratch as part of a rigorous, project-based curriculum with a focus on modern software engineering principles, full-stack development, algorithm design, system architecture, and real-world problem solving.
